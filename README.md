# Movie-recommendation-System
This is a recommendation system based on both content based and collaborative filtering to recommend movies.
Neural network models are implemented too to improve the accuracy.
Finally a model is seleced as best to recommend movies.

These models are implemented using pyspark.

The code can be entirely run on Google colab or jupyter notebook to train the model.

Streamlit is used to developed the web app.

Run Streamlit.py in the machine using **streamlit run file_name** (Streamlit.py here)
