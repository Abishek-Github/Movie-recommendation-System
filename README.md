# Movie-recommendation-System
This is a recommendation system based on both content based and collaborative filtering to recommend movies.
Neural network models are implemented too to improve the accuracy.
Finally a model is seleced as best to recommend movies.

**MovieLens100k** dataset is used for this project

**About Dataset:** This data set has 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
Simple demographic info for the users is also present

About Dataset:
These models are implemented using pyspark.
The code can be entirely run on Google colab or jupyter notebook to train the model.

Streamlit is used to developed the web app.

Run Streamlit.py in the machine using command **streamlit run file_name** (Streamlit.py here)
