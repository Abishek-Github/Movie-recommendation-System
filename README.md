# Movie-recommendation-System
This is a recommendation system based on both content based and collaborative filtering to recommend movies.
Neural network models are implemented too to improve the accuracy.
Finally a model is seleced as best to recommend movies.

These models are implemented using pyspark.

The code can be entirely run on Google colab or jupyter notebook.
